### Eclipse Installation instructions
<hr> <a id="eclipse"></a>
I generated necessary [.project] and
[.userlibraries] and added `apply plugin : 'eclipse'` line to
[build.gradle]. ... Under construction
<hr>


### Tasks
1. <a id="task-1"></a>
    This API is versioned, all routes should be prefixed with /api/v1
    <hr>
    I added in [App] class `static final String API_CONTEXT` that is
    attached to every route I have:
    - get("/api/v1/todos"): home page print all todos
    - post("/api/v1/todos"): create new todo request
    - put("/api/v1/todos/:id"): update existing request
    - delete("/api/v1/todos/:id"): deleted existing request
<hr>
2. <a id="task-2"></a>
    When the app first starts it will attempt to fetch all
    Todos in the system.
    Handle the request and return all the Todos.
    Look at the browser tool to see what is being requested
    and how and create the appropriate route
    <hr>
    get("/api/v1/todos") lambda in [App] is used to process request.
    <br>
    `findAll()` method in [TodoDaoImpl] is used to fetch all todos.
    <br>
    It is tested in [TodoDaoImplTest] class in
    test method called `existingTodosCanBeFoundByFindAll` and in 
    integration test [AppTest] method `getRequestToIndexPageReturnsListOfTodos`
<hr>
3. <a id="task-3"></a>
    When a Todo is created and the save link is clicked, 
    it will make a request to the server. 
    Handle the request by creating a Todo and setting the proper status code.
    Look at the browser tool to see what is being requested 
    and how and create the appropriate route
    <hr>
    post("/api/v1/todos/:id") lambda in [App] handles request to update
    Todo:
    1. We find by id, if such task exists, if not we throw [ApiError],
      handled in `exception` lambda (Not tested yet).
    2. We get from request new TodoTask to update. 
    3. We set id to this new Task
    4. we call `todoDao.update` method
<hr>
4. <a id="task-4"></a>
    When a previously saved Todo is deleted and the save link is clicked, 
    it will make a request to the server. 
    Handle the deletion and return 
    a blank response and the proper status code.
    <hr>
    - delete("/api/v1/todos/:id") lambda in App handles deletion of todo.
    - Integration test is [AppTest] method 
    `deletingTodoTaskActuallyDeletedTodoTask`.
    - status 204
    - empty body
    <br>
    - `delete` method in [TodoDaoImpl] is used to delete todo from db.
    - It is tested in [TodoDaoImplTest] class in method `deletingTodoWorks`.
